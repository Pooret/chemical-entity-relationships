Project Overview: Chemical Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction using NLP

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) system capable of identifying chemical entities and extracting their relations from chemical research articles and patents. By efficiently classifying chemical entities and extracting relevant information from diverse sources, the system aims to create knowledge graphs that visually represent the extracted data in a structured format, enabling users to explore relationships between different chemical entities and discover new insights.

Project Components:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
    Gather a diverse and representative dataset of chemical research articles and patents from various publicly available sources, such as PubChem, ChEMBL, ChemSpider, ChEBI, SIDER, CORD-19, and USPTO. Preprocess the data by cleaning, tokenizing, and converting it into a suitable format for NLP models.

2. Chemical Entity Recognition:
    Develop an NLP model to accurately identify and classify chemical entities in the text, including chemical names, abbreviations, formulas, and identifiers. Utilize state-of-the-art models like Transformers or Bi-LSTM and fine-tune them on the chemical domain dataset.

3. Relation Extraction:
    Design an NLP model capable of identifying and extracting relations between chemical entities, such as chemical reactions, chemical synthesis, properties, and chemical structure information. The model should handle complex and diverse relations while being robust enough to work on data from different sources and languages.

4. Knowledge Graph Construction:
    Create knowledge graphs using the identified chemical entities and extracted relations, visually representing the information in a structured and easily understandable format. These knowledge graphs should enable users to explore relationships between different chemical entities and discover new insights.

5. Evaluation and Validation:
    Evaluate the performance of the NLP models for chemical entity recognition and relation extraction using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Validate the system using a separate test dataset to ensure its robustness and accuracy in handling real-world data.

6. Documentation and Presentation:
    Document the entire project, including data collection, model development, evaluation, and results. Prepare a comprehensive report and presentation to demonstrate the system's capabilities and its potential applications in the chemistry domain.
